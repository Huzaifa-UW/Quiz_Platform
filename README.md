# SmartStudy Quiz 🎓  

SmartStudy Quiz is a simple Python-based quiz tool designed to make studying easier and more interactive.  
Instead of just reading notes, students can practice questions stored in a CSV file and get instant feedback.  

This project reflects my interest in combining programming with education — building tools that solve real problems students face.  

RUN: Run it in VS Code and in the terminal enter this:  streamlit run Quiz_app.py (This will open its complete version and wait after clicking anything its not super fast it takes 1 second, which would not feel much)

Note: All backend and logic is done by myself. For the Front-End, I asked AI for help to assist me in displaying it.

✨ Features
- Load quiz questions from a CSV file  
- Randomly select questions for variety  
- Show score at the end of the quiz  
- Easy to expand (you can add new subjects/questions by editing the CSV file)
